# Chiania - The Chia Inventory RPG Game

## [Introduction](https://discordapp.com/channels/994949585657143296/995478713561001984/995479550848933930)

"Chia Inventory" is a RPG-style NFT collection, with an unique NFT releasing conecpt: all of the NFTs are items generated during our RPG gaming process.
 
[Green Whale](https://twitter.com/mrcic3) Is playing as a storyteller and blacksmith in this endless RPG game. He continuously releases stories, quests, and events. Players who bought our NFT equipment are able to  join endless quests and events, and win more NFTs for free.

Players can also sell NFTs to allow newbies to join the game.

So, this is the concept, an RPG style endless NFT sets. Fun and story are the core values of Chia Inventory.

Mimic is a living chest and the bot who welcomes you to the world of chiania.
You spell the magic word `!register` and mimic will memorize you with your Chia Address

!register xch1example1234example4321
```

Send your NFTs / Items you use for the game to the registered address. Items you already have you can send to "yourself". The last transaction must be to the address your character has.

[There are discussions to use the Chia Network DID Feature to equip your character](https://discord.com/channels/994949585657143296/995483089881026631/999856743452508160), but this isn't implemented already

## Register for Quests

There is the Discord Room [quest-regist-02](https://discord.com/channels/994949585657143296/998007766297870416). When there is a quest announced in [quest-announcements](https://discord.com/channels/994949585657143296/995496698086432838) you have a few days time to register for it in [quest-regist-02](https://discord.com/channels/994949585657143296/998007766297870416)

## Gaming System

It is best to follow the game via the [Chia Inventory Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pDGJf5f6)

### General Game Progress

This is the gaming loop so far:

- [You buy weapons / equipment when it is released (original offers on dexie.space)](https://dexie.space/offers/col16fpva26fhdjp2echs3cr7c30gzl7qe67hu9grtsjcqldz354asjsyzp6wx/xch).
    - [This are the weapon types you can get so far](items/01_equipment.md)
- [A quest is announced (Discord or Twitter)](https://discordapp.com/channels/994949585657143296/995496698086432838)
- [You register for the quest](https://discordapp.com/channels/994949585657143296/998007766297870416)

## Speed of Events (Patience)

It's an Infinite RPG Game. So you are not in a hurry. Quests are announced a few days in advance. When events happen (such as fights or rewards) the items are minted in real time on the Chia Blockchain (they don't exist before the event). So it can last a while until you receive your items. There is a [Quest Data Log](https://discordapp.com/channels/994949585657143296/998574861918142546) on the discord server. Here you can see how your character has performed and if there were items dropped for you.

The Story progresses after previous events were processed.
