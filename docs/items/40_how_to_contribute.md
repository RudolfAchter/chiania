## How Data of Items is collected

The Data that belongs to these Items is a combination of Chia Blockchain Metadata and additional InGame Attributes that are discussed in the community.
There is some central DataSource needed for the attributes so that i can easily show them on this website.
So far i collect attributes that i can generate from Blockchain Data and SpaceScan.io API.

How Data is collected for the following pages is shown here: [Get-ChianiaItems_V4.ps1](https://github.com/RudolfAchter/chiania/blob/main/src/Get-ChianiaItems_V4.ps1). Raw Data, that is generated by the script is published here [ChianiaItems.groupByItemType.json](ChianiaItems.groupByItemType.json). You could use this data in your own projtects contributing to this project.

## How to contribute my NFT data

Contact `Chia Inventory` on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8JmQ9Wu5aF) and ask him how to contribute. Game System changes a lot currently so its best to ask

**Files can change in progress of development...**
