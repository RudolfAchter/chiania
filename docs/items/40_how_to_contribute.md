## How Data of Items is collected

The Data that belongs to these Items is a combination of Chia Blockchain Metadata and additional InGame Attributes that are discussed in the community.
There is some central DataSource needed for the attributes so that i can easily show them on this website.
So far i collect attributes that i can generate from Blockchain Data and SpaceScan.io API.

How Data is collected for the following pages is shown here: [Get-ChianiaItems_V4.ps1](https://github.com/RudolfAchter/chiania/blob/main/src/Get-ChianiaItems_V4.ps1). Raw Data, that is generated by the script is published here [ChianiaItems.groupByItemType.json](ChianiaItems.groupByItemType.json). You could use this data in your own projtects contributing to this project.


## How to contribute my NFT data

Right now there are datasources in two GitHub repositories. We try to get this into as less datasources as possible. The lowest programming language independent common denominator would be [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) data format. It would be independent of programming language and can provide very well structured data. It could be used in a NoSQL Database like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as well as in a plain file.

- [Chia-Inventory-The-Green-Whale/Chia-Inventory (official chiania repository)](https://github.com/Chia-Inventory-The-Green-Whale/Chia-Inventory)
    - look in [item_list.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chia-Inventory-The-Green-Whale/Chia-Inventory/main/item_list.py) to see how Items are put into Categories
    - in [attributes_assign.py](https://github.com/Chia-Inventory-The-Green-Whale/Chia-Inventory/blob/main/attribute_assign.py) you can contribute what ingame attributes should be assigned to the items
    - in [level_eq.csv](https://github.com/Chia-Inventory-The-Green-Whale/Chia-Inventory/blob/main/level_eq.csv) you can see how equipment stats scale with your character level. These scales are calculated from [attribute_assign.py](https://github.com/Chia-Inventory-The-Green-Whale/Chia-Inventory/blob/main/attribute_assign.py)
    - in [monster.py](https://github.com/Chia-Inventory-The-Green-Whale/Chia-Inventory/blob/main/monster.py) you can contribute your ideas for monsters.
- [RudolfAchter/chiania (repository of this website)](https://github.com/RudolfAchter/chiania)
    - data is in [config](https://github.com/RudolfAchter/chiania/tree/main/config) directory
    - in [nft_collections.json](https://github.com/RudolfAchter/chiania/blob/main/config/nft_collections.json) you can contribute your collections
    - in [nft_name_patterns.json](https://github.com/RudolfAchter/chiania/blob/main/config/nft_name_patterns.json) are regular expresssions which define with which name patterns collections of items of the same type are recognized
    - in [nft_type_patterns.json](https://github.com/RudolfAchter/chiania/blob/main/config/nft_type_patterns.json) is defined how item collections by name are recognized in which equipment category they belong to (Weapon, Armor, Herb, Ring, Shield, and so on...)

**Files can change in progress of development...**
