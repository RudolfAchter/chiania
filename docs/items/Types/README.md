## How Data of Items is collected

The Data that belongs to these Items is a combination of Chia Blockchain Metadata and additional InGame Attributes that are discussed in the community.
There is some central DataSource needed for the attributes so that i can easily show them on this website.
So far i collect attributes that i can generate from Blockchain Data and SpaceScan.io API.

How Data is collected for the following pages is shown here: [Get-ChianiaItems_V4.ps1](https://github.com/RudolfAchter/ChiaShell/blob/master/Powershell/Scripts/Get-ChianiaItems_V4.ps1)
