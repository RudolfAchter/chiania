If you manage to kill him, there are plenty other murlocs to take his place, king is dead long live the king or mrglwglwlg as murlocs say.</div></div>

<div style="clear:left;"><strong>Description:</strong> They are basicly same as skeleton warriors with one but, they still have some brain leftover in their skulls making them smart enough to use some simple magic like fire.
