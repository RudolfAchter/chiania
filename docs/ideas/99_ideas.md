# Ideas for the world

[edit here (GitHub/Rudolf Achter/chiania)](https://github.com/RudolfAchter/chiania/blob/main/docs/ideas/99_ideas.md). Your edit will be reviewed and (when it's good) included.

The world of chiania is growing while playing. Items / NFTs are minted on the go. The story can evolve day by day. Bring in your ideas. The documentations following on this page are just ideas. These things arent necessarily implemented in the game

## Magic

In a fantasy world like Chiania there should be magic. So also there would be a magic fighting system. Classical things i know are based on elements like:

- 🔥 Fire
    - Lava
    - Heat
- 🌊 Water
    - Ice
- 🌬️ Air
    - 🌪️ Wind
    - ⚡️ Electro
- 🪨 Earth
    - Stone
    - Poison

Monsters could have Elements (like the slimes already have with water, swamp and so on...). Stronger monsters could have spells based on their strength

Characters could aquire things like spirits (for an element) ans spellbooks (for specific spells for that element)
