# The World and Moving in the world

## This is what we have so far

- Basic moves are north, south, west, east
- Each "room" can have exits in each direction

## This are new ideas

## Travelling around the world

- there is already the idea of multiple continent
- there could be harbours and ships moving between those harbours
  - when we have chiania coin
  - you could have to pay a fee to the captain to get to another continent
    - a reason to use your chia wallet to go further
    - this should be chiania coin
    - chiania coin should be able to be earned by playing (we already do virtually on discord server)
- there could be gates, bridges or something like that where guards want to be paid toll to let you pass
  - you could have a coice to `!pay`, `!talk` or `!fight`
  - when you `!talk` it could be dependend on you "Charisma" value to persuade the guard to let you pass

## Dungeons could go up and down

If dungeons are in the underground or in buildings we could go "up" and "down". Player gould
- climb a ladder (up and down)
- go up or downstairs
- jump down a hole (one way down)
- use a rope to get down a hole (would need to get a rope first)

There could be even underwater things with:
- caves flooded with water
    - `!swim` (`north`|`south`|`east`|`west`|`up`|`down`)
    - limited air / oxygen
    - there should be caves you can get out of water

## Behaviour in cities

- There are already guards in cities
- There could be jails
  - Instead of killing adventurers who behave "bad" in cities the guards could "arrest" the player if the player loses the fight
