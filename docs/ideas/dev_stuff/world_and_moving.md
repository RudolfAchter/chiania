# The World and Moving in the world

## This is what we have so far

- Basic moves are north, south, west, east
- Each "room" can have exits in each direction

## This are new ideas

- there is already the idea of multiple continent
- there could be harbours and ships moving between those harbours
  - when we have chiania coin
  - you could have to pay a fee to the captain to get to another continent
    - a reason to use your chia wallet to go further
    - this should be chiania coin
    - chiania coin should be able to be earned by playing (we already do virtually on discord server)
- there could be gates, bridges or something like that where guards want to be paid toll to let you pass
  - you could have a coice to `!pay`, `!talk` or `!fight`
  - when you `!talk` it could be dependend on you "Charisma" value to persuade the guard to let you pass
