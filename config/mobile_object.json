    "description": "Grandparents usually tell their grandchildren stories of times past. Well this isn't this story, it involves a drunk necromancer that was cursed by heartbroken witch. He was so drunk that he had to take a piss, he did that near a tree. Seconds after his relief, tree became alive and pissed off by someone naked in front of it, killed the pure yet still drunk necromancer. Now corrupted tree is wandering the woods in search of a dry towel. Be careful of what you do in the woods.",
